HDR + WCG Image Viewer lets you view a variety of popular high dynamic range (HDR) image formats at full visual quality on a capable HDR10 display:
* OpenEXR
* Radiance RGBE (.hdr)
* JPEG XR (including HDR game screenshots captured on Xbox and Windows 10)

When viewing the above on a standard dynamic range (SDR) display, the app performs HDR tonemapping to achieve the best possible quality. The app also includes some useful tools for HDR developers such as rendering the image luminance as a colorized heatmap.

In addition, you can view a variety of high bit depth and/or wide color gamut (WCG) image formats on a capable display:
* JPEG with embedded ICC profile
* TIFF
